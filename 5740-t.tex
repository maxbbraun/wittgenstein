\newcommand{\TransNoteText}{%
The original publication was a parallel translation; after the introduction,
even pages contained the German original, odd pages the English translation.
This e-book has been reformatted to contain the English translation first and
the German original after that. In the PDF file, the proposition numbers are
linked back and forth between the languages.

The original used a lower-case `v' for the \emph{logical or} operator; it has been
replaced with the correct `$\lor$' character.

In the German part of the original, variables were printed upright; they have
been italicised in this e-book.

Every effort has been made to replicate the original text as faithfully as
possible. Minor typesetting errors have been corrected; all changes are detailed
in the \LaTeX{} source code.

\textit{In rendering Mr Wittgenstein's \BookTitle{Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus}
available for English readers, the somewhat unusual course has been
adopted of printing the original side by side with the translation.
Such a method of presentation seemed desirable both on account of the
obvious difficulties raised by the vocabulary and in view of the
peculiar literary character of the whole. As a result, a certain
latitude has been possible in passages to which objection might
otherwise be taken as over-literal.}

\textit{The proofs of the translation and the version of the original
which appeared in the final number of Ostwald's \BookTitle{Annalen der
Naturphilosophie (1921)} have been very carefully revised by
the author himself; and the Editor further desires to express his
indebtedness to Mr F.~P. Ramsey, of Trinity College, Cambridge,
for assistance both with the translation and in the preparation of
the book for the press.}

\Introduction

\textsc{Mr Wittgenstein's} \BookTitle{Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus}, whether
or not it prove to give the ultimate truth on the matters
with which it deals, certainly deserves, by its breadth and
scope and profundity, to be considered an important event
in the philosophical world. Starting from the principles
of Symbolism and the relations which are necessary
between words and things in any language, it applies
the result of this inquiry to various departments of traditional
philosophy, showing in each case how traditional
philosophy and traditional solutions arise out of ignorance
of the principles of Symbolism and out of misuse of
language.

The logical structure of propositions and the nature
of logical inference are first dealt with. Thence we pass
successively to Theory of Knowledge, Principles of Physics,
Ethics, and finally the Mystical (\German{das Mystische}).

In order to understand Mr Wittgenstein's book, it is
necessary to realize what is the problem with which he is
concerned. In the part of his theory which deals with
Symbolism he is concerned with the conditions which
would have to be fulfilled by a logically perfect language.
There are various problems as regards language. First,
there is the problem what actually occurs in our minds
when we use language with the intention of meaning
something by it; this problem belongs to psychology.
Secondly, there is the problem as to what is the relation
subsisting between thoughts, words, or sentences, and that
which they refer to or mean; this problem belongs to
epistemology. Thirdly, there is the problem of using
sentences so as to convey truth rather than falsehood;
% -----File: 008.png---
this belongs to the special sciences dealing with the
subject-matter of the sentences in question. Fourthly,
there is the question: what relation must one fact (such
as a sentence) have to another in order to be \emph{capable}
of being a symbol for that other? This last is a logical
question, and is the one with which Mr Wittgenstein is
concerned. He is concerned with the conditions for \emph{accurate}
Symbolism, \idEst\ for Symbolism in which a sentence
``means'' something quite definite. In practice, language
is always more or less vague, so that what we assert is
never quite precise. Thus, logic has two problems to deal
with in regard to Symbolism: (1)~the conditions for sense
rather than nonsense in combinations of symbols; (2)~the
conditions for uniqueness of meaning or reference in
symbols or combinations of symbols. A logically perfect
language has rules of syntax which prevent nonsense, and
has single symbols which always have a definite and
unique meaning. Mr Wittgenstein is concerned with the
conditions for a logically perfect language---not that any
language is logically perfect, or that we believe ourselves
capable, here and now, of constructing a logically perfect
language, but that the whole function of language is to
have meaning, and it only fulfils this function in proportion
as it approaches to the ideal language which we
postulate.

The essential business of language is to assert or
deny facts. Given the syntax of a language, the meaning
of a sentence is determinate as soon as the meaning of
the component words is known. In order that a certain
sentence should assert a certain fact there must, however
the language may be constructed, be something in common
between the structure of the sentence and the structure of
the fact. This is perhaps the most fundamental thesis
of Mr Wittgenstein's theory. That which has to be in
common between the sentence and the fact cannot, so
he contends, be itself in turn \emph{said} in language. It can,
in his phraseology, only be \emph{shown}, not said, for whatever
we may say will still need to have the same structure.
% -----File: 009.png---

The first requisite of an ideal language would be that
there should be one name for every simple, and never the
same name for two different simples. A name is a simple
symbol in the sense that it has no parts which are themselves
symbols. In a logically perfect language nothing
that is not simple will have a simple symbol. The symbol
for the whole will be a ``complex,'' containing the symbols
for the parts. In speaking of a ``complex'' we are, as
will appear later, sinning against the rules of philosophical
grammar, but this is unavoidable at the outset. ``Most
propositions and questions that have been written about
philosophical matters are not false but senseless. We
cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind at all,
but only state their senselessness. Most questions and
propositions of the \DPtypo{philosopher}{philosophers} result from the fact that
we do not understand the logic of our language. They
are of the same kind as the question whether the Good is
more or less identical than the Beautiful'' (\PropERef{4.003}). What
is complex in the world is a fact. Facts which are not
compounded of other facts are what Mr Wittgenstein calls
\German{Sachverhalte}, whereas a fact which may consist of two
or more facts is called a \German{Tatsache}: thus, for example,
``Socrates is wise'' is a \German{Sachverhalt}, as well as a \German{Tatsache},
whereas ``Socrates is wise and Plato is his pupil'' is a
\German{Tatsache} but not a \German{Sachverhalt}.

He compares linguistic expression to projection in
geometry. A geometrical figure may be projected in
many ways: each of these ways corresponds to a different
language, but the projective properties of the original
figure remain unchanged whichever of these ways may
be adopted. These projective properties correspond to
that which in his theory the proposition and the fact
must have in common, if the proposition is to assert the
fact.

In certain elementary ways this is, of course, obvious.
It is impossible, for example, to make a statement about
two men (assuming for the moment that the men may
be treated as simples), without employing two names, and
% -----File: 010.png---
if you are going to assert a relation between the two men
it will be necessary that the sentence in which you make
the assertion shall establish a relation between the two
names. If we say ``Plato loves Socrates,'' the word
``loves'' which occurs between the word ``Plato'' and the
word ``Socrates'' establishes a certain relation between
these two words, and it is owing to this fact that our
sentence is able to assert a relation between the person's
name by the words ``Plato'' and ``Socrates.'' ``We must
not say, the complex sign `$a R b$' says `$a$ stands in a
certain relation $R$ to $b$'; but we must say, that `$a$'
stands in a certain relation to `$b$' says \emph{that $a R b$}''
(\PropERef{3.1432}).

Mr Wittgenstein begins his theory of Symbolism with
the statement (\PropERef{2.1}): ``We make to ourselves pictures of
facts.'' A picture, he says, is a model of the reality, and
to the objects in the reality correspond the elements of
the picture: the picture itself is a fact. The fact that
things have a certain relation to each other is represented
by the fact that in the picture its elements have a certain
relation to one another. ``In the picture and the pictured
there must be something identical in order that the one
can be a picture of the other at all. What the picture
must have in common with reality in order to be able
to represent it after its manner---rightly or falsely---is its
form of representation'' (\PropERef{2.161}, \PropERef{2.17}).

We speak of a logical picture of a reality when we
wish to imply only so much resemblance as is essential to
its being a picture in any sense, that is to say, when we
wish to imply no more than identity of logical form.
The logical picture of a fact, he says, is a \German{Gedanke}. A
picture can correspond or not correspond with the fact and
be accordingly true or false, but in both cases it shares the
logical form with the fact. The sense in which he speaks of
pictures is illustrated by his statement: ``The gramophone
record, the musical thought, the score, the waves of sound,
all stand to one another in that pictorial internal relation
which holds between language and the world. To all of
% -----File: 011.png---
them the logical structure is common. (Like the two
youths, their two horses and their lilies in the story.
They are all in a certain sense one)'' (\PropERef{4.014}). The
possibility of a proposition representing a fact rests upon
the fact that in it objects are represented by signs. The
so-called logical ``constants'' are not represented by signs,
but are themselves present in the proposition as in the
fact. The proposition and the fact must exhibit the same
logical ``manifold,'' and this cannot be itself represented
since it has to be in common between the fact and
the picture. Mr Wittgenstein maintains that everything
properly philosophical belongs to what can only be shown,
to what is in common between a fact and its logical
picture. It results from this view that nothing correct can
be said in philosophy. Every philosophical proposition
is bad grammar, and the best that we can hope to achieve
by philosophical discussion is to lead people to see that
philosophical discussion is a mistake. ``Philosophy is
not one of the natural sciences. (The word `philosophy'
must mean something which stands above or below, but
not beside the natural sciences.) The object of philosophy
is the logical clarification of thoughts. Philosophy is not
a theory but an activity. A philosophical work consists
essentially of elucidations. The result of philosophy is
not a number of `philosophical propositions,' but to
make propositions clear. Philosophy should make clear
and delimit sharply the thoughts which otherwise are,
as it were, opaque and blurred'' (\PropERef{4.111} and \PropERef{4.112}). In
accordance with this principle the things that have to be
said in leading the reader to understand Mr Wittgenstein's
theory are all of them things which that theory itself
condemns as meaningless. With this proviso we will
endeavour to convey the picture of the world which
seems to underlie his system.

The world consists of facts: facts cannot strictly
speaking be defined, but we can explain what we mean
by saying that facts are what make propositions true, or
false. Facts may contain parts which are facts or may
% -----File: 012.png---
contain no such parts; for example: ``Socrates was a wise
Athenian,'' consists of the two facts, ``Socrates was wise,''
and ``Socrates was an Athenian.'' A fact which has no
parts that are facts is called by Mr Wittgenstein a \German{Sachverhalt}.
This is the same thing that he calls an atomic fact.
An atomic fact, although it contains no parts that are
facts, nevertheless does contain parts. If we may regard
``Socrates is wise'' as an atomic fact we perceive that it
contains the constituents ``Socrates'' and ``wise.'' If an
atomic fact is analysed as fully as \DPtypo{possibly}{possible} (theoretical,
not practical possibility is meant) the constituents finally
reached may be called ``simples'' or ``objects.'' It is not
contended by Wittgenstein that we can actually isolate
the simple or have empirical knowledge of it. It is a
logical necessity demanded by theory, like an electron.
His ground for maintaining that there must be simples
is that every complex presupposes a fact. It is not
necessarily assumed that the complexity of facts is finite;
even if every fact consisted of an infinite number of atomic
facts and if every atomic fact consisted of an infinite
number of objects there would still be objects and atomic
facts (\PropERef{4.2211}). The assertion that there is a certain
complex reduces to the assertion that its constituents
are related in a certain way, which is the assertion of
a \emph{fact}: thus if we give a name to the complex the name
only has meaning in virtue of the truth of a certain
proposition, namely the proposition asserting the relatedness
of the constituents of the complex. Thus the naming
of complexes presupposes propositions, while propositions
presupposes the naming of simples. In this way the
naming of simples is shown to be what is logically first
in logic.

The world is fully described if all atomic facts are
known, together with the fact that these are all of them.
The world is not described by merely naming all the
objects in it; it is necessary also to know the atomic facts
of which these objects are constituents. Given this total
of atomic facts, every true proposition, however complex,
% -----File: 013.png---
can theoretically be inferred. A proposition (true or
false) asserting an atomic fact is called an atomic proposition.
All atomic propositions are logically independent
of each other. No atomic proposition implies any other
or is inconsistent with any other. Thus the whole business
of logical inference is concerned with propositions which
are not atomic. Such propositions may be called
molecular.

Wittgenstein's theory of molecular propositions turns
upon his theory of the construction of truth-functions.

A truth-function of a proposition $p$ is a proposition
containing $p$ and such that its truth or falsehood depends
only upon the truth or falsehood of $p$, and similarly a
truth-function of several propositions $p$, $q$, $r$\ldots is one
containing $p$, $q$, $r$\ldots and such that its truth or falsehood
depends only upon the truth or falsehood of
$p$, $q$, $r$\ldots\ It might seem at first sight as though there
were other functions of propositions besides truth-functions;
such, for example, would be ``A believes $p$,'' for in general
A will believe some true propositions and some false
ones: unless he is an exceptionally gifted individual, we
cannot infer that $p$ is true from the fact that he believes
it or that $p$ is false from the fact that he does not believe
it. Other apparent exceptions would be such as ``$p$ is a
very complex proposition'' or ``$p$ is a proposition about
Socrates.'' Mr Wittgenstein maintains, however, for
reasons which will appear presently, that such exceptions
are only apparent, and that every function of a proposition
is really a truth-function. It follows that if we can
define truth-functions generally, we can obtain a general
definition of all propositions in terms of the original set
of atomic propositions. This Wittgenstein proceeds to
do.

It has been shown by Dr Sheffer (\BookTitle{Trans.\ Am.\ Math.\ Soc.},
Vol.~XIV. pp.~481--488) that all truth-functions of a given
set of propositions can be constructed out of either of
the two functions ``not-$p$ or not-$q$'' or ``not-$p$ and not-$q$.''
Wittgenstein makes use of the latter, assuming a knowledge
% -----File: 014.png---
of Dr Sheffer's work. The manner in which other
truth-functions are constructed out of ``not-$p$ and not-$q$''
is easy to see. ``Not-$p$ and not-$p$'' is equivalent to
``not-$p$,'' hence we obtain a definition of negation in terms
of our primitive function: hence we can define ``$p$ or $q$,''
since this is the negation of ``not-$p$ and not-$q$,'' \idEst\ of
our primitive function. The development of other truth-functions
out of ``not-$p$'' and ``$p$ or $q$'' is given in detail
at the beginning of \BookTitle{Principia Mathematica}. This gives all
that is wanted when the propositions which are arguments
to our truth-function are given by enumeration. Wittgenstein,
however, by a very interesting analysis succeeds in
extending the process to general propositions, \idEst\ to cases
where the propositions which are arguments to our truth-function
are not given by enumeration but are given as
all those satisfying some condition. For example, let $fx$
be a propositional function (\idEst\ a function whose values
are propositions), such as ``$x$ is human''---then the various
values of $fx$ form a set of propositions. We may extend
the idea ``not-$p$ and not-$q$'' so as to apply to simultaneous
denial of all the propositions which are values of $fx$. In
this way we arrive at the proposition which is ordinarily
represented in mathematical logic by the words ``$fx$
is false for all values of $x$.'' The negation of this would
be the proposition ``there is at least one $x$ for which $fx$ is
true'' which is represented by ``$(\exists x) \DotOp fx$.'' If we had
started with not-$fx$ instead of $fx$ we should have arrived
at the proposition ``$fx$ is true for all values of $x$'' which
is represented by ``$(x) \DotOp fx$.'' Wittgenstein's method of
dealing with general propositions [\idEst\ ``$(x) \DotOp fx$'' and
``$(\exists x) \DotOp fx$''] differs from previous methods by the fact
that the generality comes only in specifying the set of
propositions concerned, and when this has been done the
building up of truth-functions proceeds exactly as it would
in the case of a finite number of enumerated arguments
\enlargethispage{9pt} % enlarge to make the last line fit
$p$, $q$, $r\fourdots$

Mr Wittgenstein's explanation of his symbolism at
this point is not quite fully given in the text. The symbol
% -----File: 015.png---
he uses is $(\overline{p}, \overline{\xi}, \DPtypo{\overline{N}}{N}(\overline{\xi}))$. The following is the explanation
of this symbol:

\begin{center}{%
\begin{minipage}{0.65\textwidth}

\noindent\hangindent 1.5em $\overline{p}$ stands for all atomic propositions.

\noindent\hangindent 1.5em $\overline{\xi}$ stands for any set of propositions.

\noindent\hangindent 1.5em $\DPtypo{\overline{N}}{N}(\overline{\xi})$ stands for the negation of all the propositions
making up $\overline{\xi}$.
\end{minipage}%
}\end{center}

The whole symbol $(\overline{p}, \overline{\xi}, \DPtypo{\overline{N}}{N}(\overline{\xi}))$ means whatever can be
obtained by taking any selection of atomic propositions,
negating them all, then taking any selection of the set
of propositions now obtained, together with any of the
originals---and so on indefinitely. This is, he says, the
general truth-function and also the general form of proposition.
What is meant is somewhat less complicated
than it sounds. The symbol is intended to describe a
process by the help of which, given the atomic propositions,
all others can be manufactured. The process depends
upon:

(\textit{a})~Sheffer's proof that all truth-functions can be
obtained out of simultaneous negation, \idEst\ out of ``not-$p$
and not-$q$'';

(\textit{b})~Mr Wittgenstein's theory of the derivation of
general propositions from conjunctions and disjunctions;

(\textit{c})~The assertion that a proposition can only occur in
another proposition as argument to a truth-function.
Given these three foundations, it follows that all propositions
which are not atomic can be derived from such
as are, by a uniform process, and it is this process which
is indicated by Mr Wittgenstein's symbol.

From this uniform method of construction we arrive
at an amazing simplification of the theory of inference,
as well as a definition of the sort of propositions that
belong to logic. The method of generation which has
just been described, enables Wittgenstein to say that all
propositions can be constructed in the above manner from
atomic propositions, and in this way the totality of propositions
is defined. (The apparent exceptions which we
mentioned above are dealt with in a manner which we
% -----File: 016.png---
shall consider later.) Wittgenstein is enabled to assert
that propositions are all that follows from the totality of
atomic propositions (together with the fact that it is the
totality of them); that a proposition is always a truth-function
of atomic propositions; and that if $p$ follows from
$q$ the meaning of $p$ is contained in the meaning of $q$, from
which of course it results that nothing can be deduced
from an atomic proposition. All the propositions of logic,
he maintains, are tautologies, such, for example, as ``$p$
or not $p$.''

The fact that nothing can be deduced from an atomic
proposition has interesting applications, for example, to
causality. There cannot, in Wittgenstein's logic, be any
such thing as a causal nexus. ``The events of the future,''
he says, ``\emph{cannot} be inferred from those of the present.
Superstition is the belief in the causal nexus.'' That the
sun will rise to-morrow is a hypothesis. We do not in
fact know whether it will rise, since there is no compulsion
according to which one thing must happen because another
happens.

Let us now take up another subject---that of names.
In Wittgenstein's theoretical logical language, names are
only given to simples. We do not give two names to
one thing, or one name to two things. There is no way
whatever, according to him, by which we can describe
the totality of things that can be named, in other words,
the totality of what there is in the world. In order to be
able to do this we should have to know of some property
which must belong to every thing by a logical necessity.
It has been sought to find such a property in self-identity,
but the conception of identity is subjected by Wittgenstein
to a destructive criticism from which there seems no escape.
The definition of identity by means of the identity of indiscernibles
is rejected, because the identity of indiscernibles
appears to be not a logically necessary principle. According
to this principle $x$ is identical with $y$ if every property
of $x$ is a property of $y$, but it would, after all, be logically
possible for two things to have exactly the same properties.
% -----File: 017.png---
If this does not in fact happen that is an accidental
characteristic of the world, not a logically necessary
characteristic, and accidental characteristics of the world
must, of course, not be admitted into the structure of
logic. Mr Wittgenstein accordingly banishes identity
and adopts the convention that different letters are to
mean different things. In practice, identity is needed as
between a name and a description or between two descriptions.
It is needed for such propositions as ``Socrates
is the philosopher who drank the hemlock,'' or ``The
even prime is the next number after 1.'' For such uses
of identity it is easy to provide on Wittgenstein's system.

The rejection of identity removes one method of
speaking of the totality of things, and it will be found
that any other method that may be suggested is equally
fallacious: so, at least, Wittgenstein contends and, I
think, rightly. This amounts to saying that ``object'' is
a pseudo-concept. To say ``$x$ is an object'' is to say
nothing. It follows from this that we cannot make such
statements as ``there are more than three objects in the
world,'' or ``there are an infinite number of objects in
the world.'' Objects can only be mentioned in connexion
with some definite property. We can say ``there are more
than three objects which are human,'' or ``there are more
than three objects which are red,'' for in these statements
the word object can be replaced by a variable in the
language of logic, the variable being one which satisfies
in the first case the function ``$x$ is human''; in the second
the function ``$x$ is red.'' But when we attempt to say
``there are more than three objects,'' this substitution of
the variable for the word ``object'' becomes impossible,
and the proposition is therefore seen to be meaningless.

We here touch one instance of Wittgenstein's fundamental
thesis, that it is impossible to say anything about
the world as a whole, and that whatever can be said has
to be about bounded portions of the world. This view
may have been originally suggested by notation, and if
so, that is much in its favour, for a good notation has
% -----File: 018.png---
a subtlety and suggestiveness which at times make it
seem almost like a live teacher. Notational irregularities
are often the first sign of philosophical errors, and
a perfect notation would be a substitute for thought.
But although notation may have first suggested to
Mr Wittgenstein the limitation of logic to things within
the world as opposed to the world as a whole, yet the
view, once suggested, is seen to have much else to
recommend it. Whether it is ultimately true I do not,
for my part, profess to know. In this Introduction I
am concerned to expound it, not to pronounce upon it.
According to this view we could only say things about
the world as a whole if we could get outside the world,
if, that is to say, it ceased to be for us the whole world.
Our world may be bounded for some superior being who
can survey it from above, but for us, however finite it
may be, it cannot have a boundary, since it has nothing
outside it. Wittgenstein uses, as an analogy, the field
of vision. Our field of vision does not, for us, have a
visual boundary, just because there is nothing outside
it, and in like manner our logical world has no logical
boundary because our logic knows of nothing outside it.
These considerations lead him to a somewhat curious
discussion of Solipsism. Logic, he says, fills the world.
The boundaries of the world are also its boundaries. In
logic, therefore, we cannot say, there is this and this in
the world, but not that, for to say so would apparently
presuppose that we exclude certain possibilities, and this
cannot be the case, since it would require that logic
should go beyond the boundaries of the world as if it
could contemplate these boundaries from the other side
also. What we cannot think we cannot think, therefore
we also cannot say what we cannot think.

This, he says, gives the key to Solipsism. What
Solipsism intends is quite correct, but this cannot be
said, it can only be shown. That the world is \emph{my} world
appears in the fact that the boundaries of language (the
only language I understand) indicate the boundaries of
% -----File: 019.png---
my world. The metaphysical subject does not belong to
the world but is a boundary of the world.

We must take up next the question of molecular propositions
which are at first sight not truth-functions,
of the propositions that they contain, such, for example,
as ``A believes $p$.''

Wittgenstein introduces this subject in the statement
of his position, namely, that all molecular functions are
truth-functions. He says (\PropERef{5.54}): ``In the general propositional
form, propositions occur in a proposition only
as bases of truth-operations.'' At first sight, he goes on
to explain, it seems as if a proposition could also occur
in other ways, \exempliGratia\ ``A believes $p$.'' Here it seems superficially
as if the proposition $p$ stood in a sort of relation
to the object A. ``But it is clear that `A believes that
$p$,' `A thinks $p$,' `A says $p$' are of the form `$p$ says $p$';
and here we have no co-ordination of a fact and an object,
but a co-ordination of facts by means of a co-ordination
of their objects'' (\PropERef{5.542}).

What Mr Wittgenstein says here is said so shortly
that its point is not likely to be clear to those who have
not in mind the controversies with which he is concerned.
The theory with which he is disagreeing will be found
in my articles on the nature of truth and falsehood in
\BookTitle{Philosophical Essays} and \BookTitle{Proceedings of the Aristotelian
Society}, 1906--7. The problem at issue is the problem of
the logical form of belief, \idEst\ what is the schema representing
what occurs when a man believes. Of course, the
problem applies not only to belief, but also to a host of
other mental phenomena which may be called propositional
attitudes: doubting, considering, desiring, etc. In all
these cases it seems natural to express the phenomenon
in the form ``A doubts $p$,'' ``A desires $p$,'' etc., which
makes it appear as though we were dealing with a relation
between a person and a proposition. This cannot, of
course, be the ultimate analysis, since persons are fictions
and so are propositions, except in the sense in which they
are facts on their own account. A proposition, considered
% -----File: 020.png---
as a fact on its own account, may be a set of words which
a man says over to himself, or a complex image, or train
of images passing through his mind, or a set of incipient
bodily movements. It may be any one of innumerable
different things. The proposition as a fact on its own
account, for example the actual set of words the man
pronounces to himself, is not relevant to logic. What is
relevant to logic is that common element among all these
facts, which enables him, as we say, to \emph{mean} the fact
which the proposition asserts. To psychology, of course,
more is relevant; for a symbol does not mean what it
symbolizes in virtue of a logical relation alone, but in
virtue also of a psychological relation of intention, or
association, or what-not. The psychological part of meaning,
however, does not concern the logician. What does
concern him in this problem of belief is the logical schema.
It is clear that, when a person believes a proposition, the
person, considered as a metaphysical subject, does not
have to be assumed in order to explain what is happening.
What has to be explained is the relation between the set
of words which is the proposition considered as a fact on
its own account, and the ``objective'' fact which makes
the proposition true or false. This reduces ultimately to
the question of the meaning of propositions, that is to
say, the meaning of propositions is the only non-psychological
portion of the problem involved in the analysis
of belief. This problem is simply one of a relation of
two facts, namely, the relation between the series of words
used by the believer and the fact which makes these
words true or false. The series of words is a fact just
as much as what makes it true or false is a fact. The
relation between these two facts is not unanalysable, since
the meaning of a proposition results from the meaning
of its constituent words. The meaning of the series of
words which is a proposition is a function of the meanings
of the separate words. Accordingly, the proposition as a
whole does not really enter into what has to be explained
in explaining the meaning of a proposition. It would
% -----File: 021.png---
perhaps help to suggest the point of view which I am
trying to indicate, to say that in the cases we have been
considering the proposition occurs as a fact, not as a
proposition. Such a statement, however, must not be
taken too literally. The real point is that in believing,
desiring, etc., what is logically fundamental is the relation
of a proposition \emph{considered as a fact}, to the fact which
makes it true or false, and that this relation of two facts
is reducible to a relation of their constituents. Thus the
proposition does not occur at all in the same sense in
which it occurs in a truth-function.

There are some respects, in which, as it seems to me,
Mr Wittgenstein's theory stands in need of greater
technical development. This applies in particular to
his theory of number (\PropERef{6.02}~ff.) which, as it stands, is only
capable of dealing with finite numbers. No logic can
be considered adequate until it has been shown to be
capable of dealing with transfinite numbers. I do not
think there is anything in Mr Wittgenstein's system to
make it impossible for him to fill this lacuna.

More interesting than such questions of comparative
detail is Mr Wittgenstein's attitude towards the mystical.
His attitude upon this grows naturally out of his doctrine
in pure logic, according to which the logical proposition
is a picture (true or false) of the fact, and has in common
with the fact a certain structure. It is this common
structure which makes it capable of being a picture of
the fact, but the structure cannot itself be put into words,
since it is a structure \emph{of} words, as well as of the facts to
which they refer. Everything, therefore, which is involved
in the very idea of the expressiveness of language must
remain incapable of being expressed in language, and is,
therefore, inexpressible in a perfectly precise sense. This
inexpressible contains, according to Mr Wittgenstein, the
whole of logic and philosophy. The right method of
teaching philosophy, he says, would be to confine oneself
to propositions of the sciences, stated with all possible
clearness and exactness, leaving philosophical assertions
% -----File: 022.png---
to the learner, and proving to him, whenever he made
them, that they are meaningless. It is true that the fate
of Socrates might befall a man who attempted this method
of teaching, but we are not to be deterred by that fear, if
it is the only right method. It is not this that causes
some hesitation in accepting Mr Wittgenstein's position,
in spite of the very powerful arguments which he brings
to its support. What causes hesitation is the fact that,
after all, Mr Wittgenstein manages to say a good deal
about what cannot be said, thus suggesting to the
sceptical reader that possibly there may be some loophole
through a hierarchy of languages, or by some other
exit. The whole subject of ethics, for example, is placed
by Mr Wittgenstein in the mystical, inexpressible region.
Nevertheless he is capable of conveying his ethical
opinions. His defence would be that what he calls the
mystical can be shown, although it cannot be said. It
may be that this defence is adequate, but, for my part,
I confess that it leaves me with a certain sense of
intellectual discomfort.

There is one purely logical problem in regard to
which these difficulties are peculiarly acute. I mean the
problem of generality. In the theory of generality it is
necessary to consider all propositions of the form $fx$ where
$fx$ is a given propositional function. This belongs to
the part of logic which can be expressed, according to
Mr Wittgenstein's system. But the totality of possible
values of $x$ which might seem to be involved in the totality
of propositions of the form $fx$ is not admitted by Mr
Wittgenstein among the things that can be spoken of,
for this is no other than the totality of things in the world,
and thus involves the attempt to conceive the world as a
whole; ``the feeling of the world as a bounded whole is
the mystical''; hence the totality of the values of $x$ is
mystical (\PropERef{6.45}). This is expressly argued when Mr
Wittgenstein denies that we can make propositions as
to how many things there are in the world, as for example,
that there are more than three.
% -----File: 023.png---

These difficulties suggest to my mind some such
possibility as this: that every language has, as Mr
Wittgenstein says, a structure concerning which, \emph{in the
language}, nothing can be said, but that there may be
another language dealing with the structure of the first
language, and having itself a new structure, and that to
this hierarchy of languages there may be no limit. Mr
Wittgenstein would of course reply that his whole theory
is applicable unchanged to the totality of such languages.
The only retort would be to deny that there is any such
totality. The totalities concerning which Mr Wittgenstein
holds that it is impossible to speak logically are nevertheless
thought by him to exist, and are the subject-matter of his
mysticism. The totality resulting from our hierarchy
would be not merely logically inexpressible, but a fiction,
a mere delusion, and in this way the supposed sphere of
the mystical would be abolished. Such an hypothesis is
very difficult, and I can see objections to it which at the
moment I do not know how to answer. Yet I do not
see how any easier hypothesis can escape from Mr
Wittgenstein's conclusions. Even if this very difficult
hypothesis should prove tenable, it would leave untouched
a very large part of Mr Wittgenstein's theory, though
possibly not the part upon which he himself would wish
to lay most stress. As one with a long experience of the
difficulties of logic and of the deceptiveness of theories
which seem irrefutable, I find myself unable to be sure
of the rightness of a theory, merely on the ground that I
cannot see any point on which it is wrong. But to have
constructed a theory of logic which is not at any point
obviously wrong is to have achieved a work of extraordinary
difficulty and importance. This merit, in my
opinion, belongs to Mr Wittgenstein's book, and makes
it one which no serious philosopher can afford to neglect.

\Preface{Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus}{Preface}


This book will perhaps only be understood by those
who have themselves already thought the thoughts which
are expressed in it---or similar thoughts. It is therefore
not a text-book. Its object would be attained if there
were one person who read it with understanding and to
whom it afforded pleasure.

The book deals with the problems of philosophy and
shows, as I believe, that the method of formulating these
problems rests on the misunderstanding of the logic of
our language. Its whole meaning could be summed up
somewhat as follows: What can be said at all can be said
clearly; and whereof one cannot speak thereof one must
be silent.

The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking,
or rather---not to thinking, but to the expression of
thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to thinking we
should have to be able to think both sides of this limit
(we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot
be thought).

The limit can, therefore, only be drawn in language
and what lies on the other side of the limit will be simply
nonsense.

How far my efforts agree with those of other philosophers
I will not decide. Indeed what I have here
written makes no claim to novelty in points of detail;
and therefore I give no sources, because it is indifferent
to me whether what I have thought has already been
thought before me by another.
% -----File: 029.png---

I will only mention that to the great works of Frege
and the writings of my friend Bertrand Russell I owe in
large measure the stimulation of my thoughts.

If this work has a value it consists in two things.
First that in it thoughts are expressed, and this value will
be the greater the better the thoughts are expressed. The
more the nail has been hit on the head.---Here I am
conscious that I have fallen far short of the possible.
Simply because my powers are insufficient to cope with
the task.---May others come and do it better.

On the other hand the \emph{truth} of the thoughts communicated
here seems to me unassailable and definitive. I
am, therefore, of the opinion that the problems have in
essentials been finally solved. And if I am not mistaken
in this, then the value of this work secondly consists in the
fact that it shows how little has been done when these
problems have been solved.

\begin{propositions}
\PropositionE{1}
{The world is everything that is the case.\footnote{The decimal figures as numbers of the separate propositions indicate the logical
importance of the propositions, the emphasis laid upon them in my exposition.
The propositions \textit{n}.1, \textit{n}.2, \textit{n}.3, etc., are comments on proposition No.\;\textit{n}; the propositions
\textit{n}.\textit{m}1, \textit{n}.\textit{m}2, etc., are comments on the proposition No.\;\textit{n}.\textit{m}; and so on.}}


\PropositionE{1.1}
{The world is the totality of facts, not of
things.}


\PropositionE{1.11}
{The world is determined by the facts, and by
these being \emph{all} the facts.}


\PropositionE{1.12}
{For the totality of facts determines both what is
the case, and also all that is not the case.}


\PropositionE{1.13}
{The facts in logical space are the world.}


\PropositionE{1.2}
{The world divides into facts.}


\PropositionE{1.21}
{Any one can either be the case or not be the
case, and everything else remain the same.}


\PropositionE{2}
{What is the case, the fact, is the existence of
atomic facts.}


\PropositionE{2.01}
{An atomic fact is a combination of objects
(entities, things).}


\PropositionE{2.011}
{It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent
part of an atomic fact.}


\PropositionE{2.012}
{In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing \emph{can}
occur in an atomic fact the possibility of that
atomic fact must already be prejudged in the
thing.}


\PropositionE{2.0121}
{It would, so to speak, appear as an accident, when
to a thing that could exist alone on its own account,
subsequently a state of affairs could be made to fit.

If things can occur in atomic facts, this possibility
must already lie in them.

(A logical entity cannot be merely possible.
Logic treats of every possibility, and all possibilities
are its facts.)
% -----File: 033.png---

Just as we cannot think of spatial objects at
all apart from space, or temporal objects apart
from time, so we cannot think of \emph{any} object apart
from the possibility of its connexion with other
things.

If I can think of an object in the context of an
atomic fact, I cannot think of it apart from the
\emph{possibility} of this context.}


\PropositionE{2.0122}
{The thing is independent, in so far as it can
occur in all \emph{possible} circumstances, but this form
of independence is a form of connexion with the
atomic fact, a form of dependence. (It is impossible
for words to occur in two different ways,
alone and in the proposition.)}


\PropositionE{2.0123}
{If I know an object, then I also know all the
possibilities of its occurrence in atomic facts.

(Every such possibility must lie in the nature
of the object.)

A new possibility cannot subsequently be
found.}


\PropositionE{2.01231}
{In order to know an object, I must know not
its external but all its internal qualities.}


\PropositionE{2.0124}
{If all objects are given, then thereby are all
\emph{possible} atomic facts also given.}


\PropositionE{2.013}
{Every thing is, as it were, in a space of possible
atomic facts. I can think of this space as empty,
but not of the thing without the space.}


\PropositionE{2.0131}
{A spatial object must lie in infinite space.
(A point in space is a place for an argument.)

A speck in a visual field need not be red,
but it must have a colour; it has, so to speak,
a colour space round it. A tone must have \emph{a}

{Objects contain the possibility of all states of
affairs.}

{The object is simple.}

{Every statement about complexes can be analysed
into a statement about their constituent parts, and
into those propositions which completely describe
the complexes.}


\PropositionE{2.021}
{Objects form the substance of the world.
Therefore they cannot be compound.}


\PropositionE{2.0211}
{If the world had no substance, then whether
a proposition had sense would depend on whether
another proposition was true.}


\PropositionE{2.0212}
{It would then be impossible to form a picture
of the world (true or false).}


\PropositionE{2.022}
{It is clear that however different from the real
one an imagined world may be, it must have something---a
form---in common with the real world.}


\PropositionE{2.023}
{This fixed form consists of the objects.}


\PropositionE{2.0231}
{The substance of the world \emph{can} only determine
a form and not any material properties. For these
are first presented by the propositions---first formed
by the configuration of the objects.}


\PropositionE{2.0232}
{Roughly speaking: objects are colourless.}


\PropositionE{2.0233}
{Two objects of the same logical form are---apart
from their external prop\-er\-ties---only differentiated
from one another in that they are
different.}


\PropositionE{2.02331}
{Either a thing has properties which no other
has, and then one can distinguish it straight away
from the others by a description and refer to it;
or, on the other hand, there are several things
which have the totality of their properties in
% -----File: 037.png---
common, and then it is quite impossible to point
to any one of them.

For if a thing is not distinguished by anything,
I cannot distinguish it---for otherwise it would be
distinguished.}


\PropositionE{2.024}
{Substance is what exists independently of what
is the case.}


\PropositionE{2.025}
{It is form and content.}


\PropositionE{2.0251}
{Space, time and colour (colouredness) are forms
of objects.}


\PropositionE{2.026}
{Only if there are objects can there be a fixed
form of the world.}


\PropositionE{2.027}
{The fixed, the existent and the object are
one.}


\PropositionE{2.0271}
{The object is the fixed, the existent; the configuration
is the changing, the variable.}


\PropositionE{2.0272}
{The configuration of the objects forms the
atomic fact.}


\PropositionE{2.03}
{In the atomic fact objects hang one in another,
like the members of a chain.}


\PropositionE{2.031}
{In the atomic fact the objects are combined in
a definite way.}


\PropositionE{2.032}
{The way in which objects hang together in
the atomic fact is the structure of the atomic
fact.}


\PropositionE{2.033}
{The form is the possibility of the structure.}


\PropositionE{2.034}
{The structure of the fact consists of the structures
of the atomic facts.}


\PropositionE{2.04}
{The totality of existent atomic facts is the
world.}


\PropositionE{2.05}
{The totality of existent atomic facts also determines
which atom\-ic facts do not exist.}


\PropositionE{2.06}
{The existence and non-existence of atomic facts
is the reality.

(The existence of atomic facts we also call
a positive fact, their non-existence a negative
fact.)}

{Atomic facts are independent of one another.}

the existence and non-ex\-is\-tence of atomic
facts.}

{To the objects correspond in the picture the
elements of the picture.}

{The elements of the picture stand, in the picture,
for the objects.}

are combined with one another in a definite way.}


\PropositionE{2.141}
{The picture is a fact.}

{That the elements of the picture are combined
with one another in a definite way, represents that

This connexion of the elements of the picture is
called its structure, and the possibility of this structure
is called the form of representation of the picture.}

{The form of representation is the possibility that
the things are combined with one another as are
the elements of the picture.}

up to it.}

{According to this view the representing relation
which makes it a picture, also belongs to the
picture.}

{The representing relation consists of the co-ordinations
of the elements of the picture and the
things.}

something identical in order that the one can be a
picture of the other at all.}

reality in order to be able to represent it after its
manner---rightly or falsely---is its form of representation.}

{The picture can represent every reality whose
form it has.

The spatial picture, everything spatial, the
coloured, everything coloured, etc.}

{The picture, however, cannot represent its form
of representation; it shows it forth.}


\PropositionE{2.173}
{The picture represents its object from without
(its standpoint is its form of representation), therefore
the picture represents its object rightly or
falsely.}

{But the picture cannot place itself outside of its
form of representation.}


\PropositionE{2.18}

{If the form of representation is the logical form,
then the picture is called a logical picture.}

{It used to be said that God could create everything,

{To present in language anything which
``contradicts logic'' is as impossible as in

as the sign of equality, and as the expression of
existence; ``to exist'' as an intransitive verb like
``to go''; ``identical'' as an adjective; we speak
of \emph{something} but also of the fact of \emph{something}

$F(fx)$ could be its own argument, then there would
be a proposition ``$F(F(fx))$'', and in this the outer
function $F$ and the inner function $F$ must have
different meanings; for the inner has the form
$\phi(fx)$, the outer the form $\psi(\phi(fx))$. Common to
both functions is only the letter ``$F$'', which by
itself signifies nothing.}

A black spot on white paper; the form of the spot

plane whether it is white or black. To the fact
that a point is black corresponds a positive fact;
to the fact that a point is white (not black), a
negative fact. If I indicate a point of the plane
(a truth-value in Frege's terminology), this corresponds
to the assumption proposed for judgment,
etc.\ etc.

But to be able to say that a point is black or
white, I must first know under what conditions a
point is called white or black; in order to be able
to say ``$p$'' is true (or false) I must have determined
under what conditions I call ``$p$'' true,

The point at which the simile breaks down is
this: we can indicate a point on the paper, without
knowing what white and black are; but to a proposition
without a sense corresponds nothing at
all, for it signifies no thing (truth-value) whose

``internal relation''.

properties we can now speak also of formal

clear the confusion of formal concepts with proper
concepts which runs through the whole of the old
logic.)

That anything falls under a formal concept as
an object belonging to it, cannot be expressed by
a proposition. But it shows itself in the sign of
this object itself. (The name shows that it signifies
an object, the numerical sign that it signifies a
number, etc.)

Formal concepts cannot, like proper concepts,
be presented by a function.

For their characteristics, the formal properties,
are not expressed by the functions.

The expression of a formal property is a feature
of certain symbols.

The sign that signifies the characteristics of a
formal concept is, therefore, a characteristic feature
of all symbols, whose meanings fall under the
concept.

The expression of the formal concept is therefore
a propositional variable in which only this
characteristic feature is constant.}


\PropositionE{4.127}
{The propositional variable signifies the formal
concept, and its values signify the objects which
fall under this concept.}


\PropositionE{4.1271}
{Every variable is the sign of a formal
concept.

For every variable presents a constant form,
which all its values possess, and which can
be conceived as a formal property of these
values.}


\PropositionE{4.1272}
{So the variable name ``$x$'' is the proper sign of
the pseudo-concept \emph{object}.

Wherever the word ``object'' (``thing'', ``entity'',
etc.) is rightly used, it is expressed in logical
symbolism by the variable name.

For example in the proposition ``there are two
objects which\ \ldots'', by ``$(\exists x,y)$\ \ldots''.

Wherever it is used otherwise, \idEst\ as a proper
concept word, there arise senseless pseudo-propositions.

So one cannot, \exempliGratia\ say ``There are objects''
as one says ``There are books''. Nor ``There
are 100 objects'' or ``There are $\aleph_0$ objects''. And
it is senseless to speak of the \emph{number of all
objects}.

The same holds of the words ``Complex'',
``Fact'', ``Function'', ``Number'', etc.

They all signify formal concepts and are
presented in logical symbolism by variables, not
by functions or classes (as Frege and Russell
thought).

Expressions like ``1 is a number'', ``there is
only one number nought'', and all like them are
senseless.

to 4.)}

{The formal concept is already given with an
object, which falls under it. One cannot, therefore,
introduce both, the objects which fall under
a formal concept \emph{and} the formal concept itself,
as primitive ideas. One cannot, therefore, \exempliGratia\ introduce
(as Russell does) the concept of function
and also special functions as primitive ideas; or
the concept of number and definite numbers.}


\PropositionE{4.1273}
{If we want to express in logical symbolism
the general proposition ``$b$ is a successor of $a$''
we need for this an expression for the general
term of the formal series: $aRb$, $(\exists x) : aRx \DotOp xRb$,
$(\exists x,y) : aRx \DotOp xRy \DotOp yRb$,\;\ldots\ The general term of
a formal series can only be expressed by a
variable, for the concept symbolized by ``term of
this formal series'' is a \emph{formal} concept. (This
Frege and Russell overlooked; the way in
which they express general propositions like the
above is, therefore, false; it contains a vicious
circle.)

We can determine the general term of the
formal series by giving its first term and the
general form of the operation, which generates
the following term out of the preceding proposition.}

{It is natural to confuse the arguments of

recognize the meaning of the sign containing it
from the argument just as much as from the
index.

In Russell's ``$\DPtypo{+}{+_{c}}$'', for example, ``$c$'' is an
index which indicates that the whole sign is the
addition sign for cardinal numbers. But this way
of symbolizing depends on arbitrary agreement,
and one could choose a simple sign instead of
``$+_{c}$'': but in ``$\Not{p}$'' ``$p$'' is not an index but
an argument; the sense of ``$\Not{p}$'' \emph{cannot} be understood,
unless the sense of ``$p$'' has previously been
understood. (In the name Julius Csar, Julius is
an index. The index is always part of a description
of the object to whose name we attach it, \exempliGratia\ \emph{The}
Csar of the Julian gens.)

am not mistaken, at the root of Frege's theory

we must understand it in propositions of the form
``$\Not{p}$'', just as in propositions like ``$\Not{(p \lor q)}$'',
``$(\exists x) \DotOp \Not{fx}$'' and others. We may not first
introduce it for one class of cases and then for
another, for it would then remain doubtful whether
its meaning in the two cases was the same, and
there would be no reason to use the same way of
symbolizing in the two cases.

parts.

(Even if we believe that we have done
so.)

Thus ``Socrates is identical'' says nothing,
because we have given \emph{no} meaning to the word
``identical'' as \emph{adjective}. For when it occurs as
the sign of equality it symbolizes in an entirely
different way---the symbolizing relation is another---therefore
the symbol is in the two cases entirely

{Every truth-function is a result of the successive
application of the operation \mbox{(--\;--\;--\;--\;--T)}\AllowBreak($\xi, \fourdots$) to

of these propositions.}

{An expression in brackets whose terms are
propositions I in\-di\-cate---if the order of the terms
in the bracket is indifferent---by a sign of the form
``($\overline{\xi}$)''. ``$\xi$'' is a variable whose values are the
terms of the expression in brackets, and the line
over the variable indicates that it stands for all
its values in the bracket.

(Thus if $\xi$ has the 3 values P, Q, R, then
($\overline{\xi}$) = (P, Q, R).)

The values of the variables must be determined.

{\stretchyspace
The determination is the description of the propositions
which the variable stands for.}

How the description of the terms of the expression
in brackets takes place is unessential.

We may distinguish 3 kinds of description:
1.~Direct enumeration. In this case we can place
simply its constant values instead of the variable.
2.~Giving a function $fx$, whose values for all
values of $x$ are the propositions to be described.
3.~Giving a formal law, according to which those
propositions are constructed. In this case the

``$N(\overline{\xi})$''.

$N(\overline{\xi})$ is the negation of all the values of the
propositional variable $\xi$.}


\PropositionE{5.503}
{As it is obviously easy to express how propositions
can be constructed by means of this operation
and how propositions are not to be constructed by

\PropositionE{5.51}
{If $\xi$ has only one value, then $N(\overline{\xi}) = \Not{p}$ (not $p$),
if it has two values then $N(\overline{\xi}) = \Not{p} \DotOp \Not{q}$ (neither
$p$ nor $q$).}

{How can the all-embracing logic which mirrors
the world use such special catches and manipulations?
Only because all these are connected into
an infinitely fine network, to the great mirror.}


\PropositionE{5.512}
{``$\Not{p}$'' is true if ``$p$'' is false. Therefore in the
true proposition ``$\Not{p}$'' ``$p$'' is a false proposition.
How then can the stroke ``$\Not{}$'' bring it into
agreement with reality?

That which denies in ``$\Not{p}$'' is however not
``$\Not{}$'', but that which all signs of this notation,
which deny $p$, have in common.

Hence the common rule according to which
``$\Not{p}$'', ``$\Not{\Not{\Not{p}}}$'', ``${\Not{p}} \lor {\Not{p}}$'', ``$\Not{p} \DotOp \Not{p}$'',
etc.\ etc.\ (to infinity) are constructed. And this
which is common to them all mirrors denial.}


\PropositionE{5.513}
{We could say: What is common to all symbols,
which assert both $p$ and $q$, is the proposition
``$p \DotOp q$''. What is common to all symbols, which
assert either $p$ or $q$, is the proposition ``$p \lor q$''.

And similarly we can say: Two propositions
are opposed to one another when they have
nothing in common with one another; and every
proposition has only one negative, because there
is only one proposition which lies altogether
outside it.

Thus even in Russell's notation it is evident
that ``${q : p} \lor {\Not{p}}$'' says the same as ``$q$''; that
``$p \lor {\Not{p}}$'' says nothing.}


\PropositionE{5.514}
{If a notation is fixed, there is in it a rule according
to which all the propositions denying $p$ are

according to which all the propositions asserting
$p$ or $q$ are constructed, and so on. These rules
are equivalent to the symbols and in them their
sense is mirrored.}


\PropositionE{5.515}

is connected by ``$\lor$'', ``$\DotOp$'', etc., must be propositions.

``$p$'' in ``$p \lor q$'' does not stand for a complex sign,
then by itself it cannot have sense; but then also
the signs ``$p \lor p$'', ``$p \DotOp p$'', etc.\ which have the

``$p \lor p$'' has no sense, then also ``$p \lor q$'' can have

$a$ satisfies the function $f$, and not that only such
things satisfy the function $f$ which have a certain

\PropositionE{6.1203}
{In order to recognize a tautology as such, we
can, in cases in which no sign of generality occurs
in the tautology, make use of the following intuitive
method: I write instead of ``$p$'', ``$q$'', ``$r$'', etc.,
``$TpF$'', ``$TqF$'', ``$TrF$'', etc. The truth-combinations
I express by brackets, \exempliGratia:

and the co-ordination of the truth or falsity of the
whole proposition with the truth-combinations of
the truth-arguments by lines in the following way:
\Illustration[0.4\textwidth]{brackets02-en}

This sign, for example, would therefore present
the proposition $p \Implies q$. Now I will proceed
to inquire whether such a proposition as $\Not{(p \DotOp \Not{p})}$
(The Law of Contradiction) is a tautology. The
form ``$\Not{\xi}$'' is written in our notation

the form ``$\xi \DotOp \eta$'' thus:---

If here we put ``$p$'' instead of ``$q$'' and examine
the combination of the outermost T and F with the
innermost, it is seen that the truth of the whole
proposition is co-ordinated with \emph{all} the truth-combinations
of its argument, its falsity with none of
the truth-combinations.}

have sense. And this is their connexion with the
world. It is clear that it must show something
about the world that certain combinations of symbols---which
essentially have a definite character---are
tautologies. Herein lies the decisive point. We
said that in the symbols which we use much is
arbitrary, much not. In logic only this expresses:
but this means that in logic it is not \emph{we} who express,
by means of signs, what we want, but in logic the
nature of the essentially necessary signs itself
asserts. That is to say, if we know the logical

out of other logical propositions by applying in
succession certain operations, which again generate
tautologies out of the first. (And from a tautology

Let us imagine a white surface with irregular

picture these make I can always get as near as
I like to its description, if I cover the surface
with a sufficiently fine square network and now
say of every square that it is white or black.
In this way I shall have brought the description
of the surface to a unified form. This form is
arbitrary, because I could have applied with equal
success a net with a triangular or hexagonal
mesh. It can happen that the description would
have been simpler with the aid of a triangular
mesh; that is to say we might have described
the surface more accurately with a triangular,
and coarser, than with the finer square mesh, or
vice versa, and so on. To the different networks
correspond different systems of describing the
world. Mechanics determine a form of description
by saying: All propositions in the description
of the world must be obtained in a given
way from a number of given propositions---the
mechanical axioms. It thus provides the bricks
for building the edifice of science, and says:
Whatever building thou wouldst erect, thou shalt
construct it in some manner with these bricks

this kind.) But \emph{this} does characterize the picture,
the fact, namely, that it can be \emph{completely} described

So too the fact that it can be described by
Newtonian mechanics asserts nothing about the
world; but \emph{this} asserts something, namely, that

it is described, as is indeed the case. The fact,

has nothing to do with philosophy: and then
always, when someone else wished to say something
metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he
had given no meaning to certain signs in his
propositions. This method would be unsatisfying
to the other---he would not have the feeling that
we were teaching him philosophy---but it would be

\Preface{Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung}{Vorwort}


Dieses Buch wird vielleicht nur der verstehen, der
die Gedanken, die darin ausgedrckt sind---oder doch
hnliche Gedanken---schon selbst einmal gedacht hat.---Es
ist also kein Lehrbuch.---Sein Zweck wre erreicht,
wenn es Einem, der es mit Verstndnis liest Vergngen
bereitete.

Das Buch behandelt die philosophischen Probleme und
zeigt---wie ich glau\-be---dass die Fragestellung dieser Probleme
auf dem Missverstndnis der Logik unserer Sprache
beruht. Man knnte den ganzen Sinn des Buches etwa in
die Worte fassen: Was sich berhaupt sagen lsst, lsst
sich klar sagen; und wovon man nicht reden kann, darber
muss man schweigen.

Das Buch will also dem Denken eine Grenze ziehen, oder
viel\-mehr---nicht dem Denken, sondern dem Ausdruck der
Gedanken: Denn um dem Denken eine Grenze zu ziehen,
mssten wir beide Seiten dieser Grenze denken knnen (wir
mssten also denken knnen, was sich nicht denken
lsst).

Die Grenze wird also nur in der Sprache gezogen werden
knnen und was jenseits der Grenze liegt, wird einfach
Unsinn sein.

Wieweit meine Bestrebungen mit denen anderer Philosophen
zusammenfallen, will ich nicht beurteilen. Ja, was
ich hier geschrieben habe macht im Einzelnen berhaupt
nicht den Anspruch auf Neuheit; und darum gebe ich auch
keine Quellen an, weil es mir gleichgltig ist, ob das was
ich gedacht habe, vor mir schon ein anderer gedacht hat.
% -----File: 028.png---

Nur das will ich erwhnen, dass ich den grossartigen
Werken Freges und den Arbeiten meines Freundes Herrn
Bertrand Russell einen grossen Teil der Anregung zu
meinen Gedanken schulde.

Wenn diese Arbeit einen Wert hat, so besteht er in
Zweierlei. Erstens darin, dass in ihr Gedanken ausgedrckt
sind, und dieser Wert wird umso grsser sein, je
besser die Gedanken ausgedrckt sind. Je mehr der
Nagel auf den Kopf getroffen ist.---Hier bin ich mir
bewusst, weit hinter dem Mglichen zurckgeblieben zu
sein. Einfach darum, weil meine Kraft zur Bewltigung
der Aufgabe zu gering ist.---Mgen andere kommen und
es besser machen.

Dagegen scheint mir die \Emph{Wahrheit} der hier mitgeteilten
Gedanken unantastbar und definitiv. Ich bin
also der Meinung, die Probleme im Wesentlichen
endgltig gelst zu haben. Und wenn ich mich hierin
nicht irre, so besteht nun der Wert dieser Arbeit zweitens
darin, dass sie zeigt, wie wenig damit getan ist, dass
diese Probleme gelst sind.

dann noch einmal fr eine andere einfhren.

Das, was in \glqq{}$\Not{p}$\grqq{} verneint, ist aber nicht das
\glqq{}$\Not{}$\grqq{}, sondern dasjenige, was allen Zeichen dieser
Notation, welche $p$ verneinen, gemeinsam ist.

Also die gemeinsame Regel, nach welcher

{Die Newtonsche Mechanik \zumBeispiel\ bringt die Weltbeschreibung
auf eine einheitliche Form. Denken
% -----File: 174.png---
wir uns eine weisse Flche, auf der unregelmssige
schwarze Flecken wren. Wir sagen nun: Was fr
ein Bild immer hierdurch entsteht, immer kann ich
seiner Beschreibung beliebig nahe kommen, indem
ich die Flche mit einem entsprechend feinen quadratischen
Netzwerk bedecke und nun von jedem
Quadrat sage, dass es weiss oder schwarz ist. Ich
werde auf diese Weise die Beschreibung der Flche
auf eine einheitliche Form gebracht haben. Diese
Form ist beliebig, denn ich htte mit dem gleichen
Erfolge ein Netz aus dreieckigen oder sechseckigen
Maschen verwenden knnen. Es kann sein, dass
die Beschreibung mit Hilfe eines Dreiecks-Netzes
einfacher geworden wre; das heisst, dass wir die
Flche mit einem grberen Dreiecks-Netz genauer
beschreiben knnten, als mit einem feineren quadratischen
(oder umgekehrt) usw. Den verschiedenen
Netzen entsprechen verschiedene Systeme der
Weltbeschreibung. Die Mechanik bestimmt eine
Form der Weltbeschreibung, indem sie sagt:
Alle Stze der Weltbeschreibung mssen aus einer
Anzahl gegebener Stze---den mechanischen Axiomen---auf
eine gegebene Art und Weise erhalten
werden. Hierdurch liefert sie die Bausteine zum
Bau des wissenschaftlichen Gebudes und sagt:
Welches Gebude immer du auffhren willst, jedes
musst du irgendwie mit diesen und nur diesen
Bausteinen zusammenbringen.

(Wie man mit dem Zahlensystem jede beliebige
Anzahl, so muss man mit dem System der
Mechanik jeden beliebigen Satz der Physik
hinschreiben knnen.)}


\PropositionG{6.342}
{Und nun sehen wir die gegenseitige Stellung
von Logik und Mechanik. (Man knnte das Netz
auch aus verschiedenartigen Figuren etwa aus
Dreie\discretionary{k-}{}{c}ken und Sechsecken bestehen lassen.) Dass
sich ein Bild, wie das vorhin erwhnte, durch ein
Netz von gegebener Form beschreiben lsst, sagt
% -----File: 176.png---
ber das Bild \Emph{nichts} aus. (Denn dies gilt fr
jedes Bild dieser Art.) \Emph{Das} aber charakterisiert
das Bild, dass es sich durch ein bestimmtes Netz
von \Emph{bestimmter} Feinheit \Emph{vollstndig} beschreiben
lsst.

So auch sagt es nichts ber die Welt aus, dass
sie sich durch die Newtonsche Mechanik beschreiben
lsst; wohl aber, dass sie sich \Emph{so} durch
jene beschreiben lsst, wie dies eben der Fall ist.
Auch das sagt etwas ber die Welt, dass sie sich
durch die eine Mechanik einfacher beschreiben
lsst, als durch die andere.}

aber ist \Emph{rein} geometrisch, alle seine Eigenschaften
knnen a priori angegeben werden.

vom Netz, nicht von dem, was das Netz beschreibt.}

sondern nur mit einem anderen Vorgang (etwa
mit dem Gang des Chronometers).

Daher ist die Beschreibung des zeitlichen
Verlaufs nur so mglich, dass wir uns auf einen
anderen Vorgang sttzen.

Ganz Analoges gilt fr den Raum. Wo man
\zumBeispiel\ sagt, es knne keines von zwei Ereignissen
(die sich gegenseitig aus\-schlies\-sen) eintreten, weil
\Emph{keine Ursache} vorhanden sei, warum das eine
eher als das andere eintreten solle, da handelt es
sich in Wirklichkeit darum, dass man gar nicht
\Emph{eines} der beiden Ereignisse beschreiben kann,
wenn nicht irgend eine Asymmetrie vorhanden ist.
Und \Emph{wenn} eine solche Asymmetrie vorhanden \Emph{ist},
so knnen wir diese als \Emph{Ursache} des Eintreffens
des einen und Nicht-Eintreffens des anderen
auffassen.}

{Das Kant'sche Problem von der rechten und
linken Hand, die man nicht zur Deckung bringen
kann, besteht schon in der Ebene, ja im eindimensionalen
Raum, wo die beiden kongruenten
Figuren $a$ und $b$ auch nicht zur Deckung gebracht
werden knnen, ohne aus diesem Raum
herausbewegt zu werden. Rechte und linke Hand
sind tatschlich vollkommen kongruent. Und
dass man sie nicht zur Deckung bringen kann,
hat damit nichts zu tun.

Fall eintreten.}

etwas Unantastbarem stehen, wie die lteren bei
Gott und dem Schicksal.

Alten sind allerdings insofern klarer, als sie einen
klaren Abschluss anerkennen, whrend es bei dem
neuen System scheinen soll, als sei \Emph{alles} erklrt.}

{Die Welt ist unabhngig von meinem Willen.}


\PropositionG{6.374}
{Auch wenn alles, was wir wnschen, geschhe,
so wre dies doch nur, sozusagen, eine Gnade des
Schicksals, denn es ist kein \Emph{logischer} Zusammenhang

verbrgte, und den angenommenen physikalischen
Zusammenhang knnten wir doch nicht selbst
wieder wollen.}

{Dass \zumBeispiel\ zwei Farben zugleich an einem Ort
des Gesichtsfeldes sind, ist unmglich und zwar
logisch unmglich, denn es ist durch die logische
Struktur der Farbe ausgeschlossen.

Denken wir daran, wie sich dieser Widerspruch
in der Physik darstellt: Ungefhr so, dass ein
Teilchen nicht zu gleicher Zeit zwei Geschwindigkeiten
haben kann; das heisst, dass es nicht zu
gleicher Zeit an zwei Orten sein kann; das heisst,
dass Teilchen an verschiedenen Orten zu Einer Zeit
nicht identisch sein knnen.

(Es ist klar, dass das logische Produkt zweier
Elementarstze weder eine Tautologie noch eine
Kontradiktion sein kann. Die Aussage, dass ein

verschiedene Farben hat, ist eine Kontradiktion.)}

{Der erste Gedanke bei der Aufstellung eines

aber klar, dass die Ethik nichts mit Strafe und
Lohn im gewhnlichen Sinne zu tun hat. Also
muss diese Frage nach den \Emph{Folgen} einer Handlung
belanglos sein.---Zum Mindesten drfen diese
Folgen nicht Ereignisse sein. Denn etwas muss
doch an jener Fragestellung richtig sein. Es muss

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the

     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
